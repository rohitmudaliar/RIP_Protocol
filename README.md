# RIP_Protocol
Implementation-of-RIP-Protocol This is a distance-vector routing protocol where each node on the network executes RIP to exchange routing information with its neighbors, and based on this information, a node computes the shortest path from itself to all the other nodes and the external internet. In this project, an incessant functioning is ensured in the event of any nodeâ€™s disappearance and reappearance.
